# Herakles App

This is a basic react-native app, powered by expo. It's scope is simply to provide a webview and point it at a users self-hosted device, providing a similar experience to a progressive web app, and using the tools provided by [herakles-lib](https://github.com/samizdapp/herakles-lib) to provide access to the device transparently via WAN or LAN, whichever is available.
